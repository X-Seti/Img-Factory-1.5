What's fixed and still todo.

Some files in components are shared functions, like img_core_classes, col_core_classes. before we split this into;
Example;

* methods/img_entry_operations.py - Entry management (add, remove, get)
* methods/img_file_operations.py - File I/O operations
* methods/img_detection.py - RW version detection
* methods/img_validation.py - File validation

Before we recreate these files we need to check if there are any existing functions in methods/ we can add code to, so we don't end up with duplicate functions.

1. Multiple tabs open img/col, export_via.py, export.py and dump.py functions can't see the current selected tab.

2. export.py collision functions export all the files combined!!
12Mb file for each, should be single files.

3. import and remove single collision objects.


Todo, Drag and Drop files/ folders onto the imgfactory app, to be imported.

Todo, fix the highlighting function, 28/28 files, when I know 10 of them already existed.

Export_via.py - Needs another button on the export dialog to save to your "choosen folder" left of the "Export Via IDE" button, not just the defined assist folder.

Import_via.py needs to ask where to get the files to import, another import box to choose the files location under the IDE file select.
