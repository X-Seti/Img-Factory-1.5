What's fixed and still todo.

Some files in components are shared functions, like img_core_classes, col_core_classes. before we split this into;
Example;

* methods/img_entry_operations.py - Entry management (add, remove, get)
* methods/img_file_operations.py - File I/O operations
* methods/img_detection.py - RW version detection

Before we recreate these files we need to check if there are any existing functions in methods/ we can add code to, so we don't end up with duplicate functions.

2. export.py collision functions export all the files combined!!
12Mb file for each, should be single files.

3. import and remove single collision objects.


Todo, Drag and Drop files/ folders onto the imgfactory app, to be imported.

Todo, fix the highlighting function, 28/28 files, when I know 10 of them already existed.

-------------------------------- >

Add the ability to also import iff (Amiga) images for 8bit textures import

and splash screen txd texture support gtaIII, vc and sa. (plus other platforms)

dimension limiting to 2"x, because of importing splash screens, 1280x720, 720x576, 640x480.

texture renaming limit set to 32 characters, but able to change these in settings.

Txd RW ID, see images.

Save game format.

Bumpmap generator, add and del them as needed.

Deluxe Paint / Paint Net style image editor. For manually editing images,

check dff texture list.

build txd, from texture list, or reading the txd information from the dff / mdl files.



------------ semi completed ---- >

Import_via.py needs to ask where to get the files to import, another import box to choose the files location under the IDE file select.

Fixed - Sep09
Import.py added files but renderware information is being lost.

Fixed - Sep09
Remove functions, both remove.py and remove_via,py work without error.
Only issue is removing every entry from the img file, leaving 0 files?
This needs a work around.
