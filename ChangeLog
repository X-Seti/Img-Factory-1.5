What's fixed and still todo.

Partly Fixed - Aug7
Import function needs work, import_via ide gives an error, no .ide file found or no files in .ide.

Todo, Add options for folder contents import.

Todo, Add import via textfile.txt list, could be either modelname.dff, textuename.txd in a single list, in no order.
- function needs to be smart to understand and read the file contents.

Todo, Drag and Drop files/ folders onto the imgfactory app, to be imported.

Todo, fix the highlighting function, 28/28 files, when I know 10 of them already existed.

Todo, Fix the Save Entry function.
